============

Android App that controls LEDI.

Created exclusively for LEDI, it uses bluetooth SPP to communicate
against LEDI. The source code has been referenced from an excellent open
source project `MetaWatch`.

The App source code has been extensively modified to work with LEDI. 
Currently, it supports the following features:

* set the current time on LEDI
* subscribe from notification on your android phone and forward it to LEDI
* allows sending arbitrary messages to LEDI over bluetooth
* virtual LEDI screen allows user to draw anything on LEDI wirelessly!
* allows toggle of IO pins on the microcontroller for controlling
  hardware extensions

This app makes LEDI into a personal information ticker that will notify
important messages to you. With continued development of this Android app,
much more interesting features are possible.
